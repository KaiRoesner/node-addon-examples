# N-API External Lib Demo

This is an example project that demonstrates how to wrap an external C++ library (i.e. one that we do not own ourselves) in a Node module.

To build and run this program on your system, clone it to your computer and run these two commands inside your clone:

```
npm install
npm test
```

> You need to have Node 10.5.0 or later installed.
